I tell you what, Antonio—I love you, and I'm speaking out of love—there are some people whose faces are so unmoving that they grow scum like a still pond, and they try hard to maintain a still expression so that they can seem to be wise, serious, and profound, like someone who could say, "I am Sir Oracle, and when I open my lips to speak, let no dog bark!" Oh my Antonio, these kind of men only have the reputation of wisdom because they say nothing, and I'm sure that if they should speak, everyone listening would realize they are fools.
If I went to church and saw its stone construction, I couldn't help but think of dangerous rocks that could break the sides of my ships and scatter valuable spices all over the water, causing my silks to fall out and drape on the waves.
But if you shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, by lending me money again, I have no doubt that I will bring both arrows back to you, because I'll watch the second one more carefully.
Some people are always happy and could even laugh at a funeral, while others are so sour they don't even crack a smile at anything, not even at a joke that Nestor called the funniest.
If doing the right thing were as easy as knowing the right thing to do, people would be better off, little chapels would be big churches, and poor men's cottages would be princes' palaces.
If I saw the sands run in an hourglass, I would think of flat shallows where my ship, "The Andrew," run aground with all its riches and flipped over, completely done for.
He has set up a lottery where your suitors will have to choose between chests of gold, silver, and lead, and whoever chooses the right one will win you as a wife.
I'd rather destroy my liver with wine than waste away with sad groans. Why should a warm-blooded man be as cold and stoic as a statue of his dead grandfather?
So, I shot another arrow the same exact way and paid better attention to it so that I could follow its course, and it led me to the first arrow.
So go forth and see how far my credit will get you in Venice, all of which I will use to get you to Belmont and to beautiful Portia.
I could more easily teach twenty people what the right thing to do is than actually be one of those twenty and have to follow my own teaching.
Antonio, if I only had the means to stand as a rival with these suitors, I know without a doubt that I would be successful in wooing her!
They tower over the little trade boats that they pass by, sailing along, and it's as if the little boats bow before the greatness of your ships.
I'd get upset blowing on my hot soup, because it would make me think of what a strong wind at sea could do to my ships.
Believe me, sir, if I were involved in a trade venture like yours, most of my mental energy would be with my ships, as well.
Her blonde hair hangs over her temples like the Golden Fleece, and it makes many a Jason want to come on a quest for her.
I'd be pulling up shoots of grass to use them to check the wind, and looking at maps of ports and piers and roads.
It would be just as easy for you to laugh and jump around and just say you are happy because you are not sad.
We've occasionally exchanged some knowing glances. Her name is Portia, and she lives up to her namesake, Cato's daughter and the wife of Brutus.
Oh my, that I used the word "choose!" I can neither choose to marry the one I want nor refuse the ones I don't.
And any little thing that might make me worry that something bad would happen to my ships would make me sad, without a doubt.
Why should he be so inactive that he is practically asleep while awake, and start to get jaundice from being cranky so much?
Trying to find the point of what he's talking about is like looking for two grains of wheat hidden in bushels of hay.
You could look all day before you find them, and once you do it's not even worth the effort you put into it.
But as I see it, it seems that those who live in excess are as unhappy as those who starve with nothing.
But I don't know how I caught, found, or came by this sadness; what it's about; or where it came from.
Your mind is focused on the ocean where your merchant ships are sailing like rich, important men parading on the sea.
I am certain that people will lend me the money, either for my own sake or for the sake of my business.
There's a lady in Belmont who has inherited some riches and is both beautiful—more beautiful than can be described—and virtuous.
I owe you a lot, and like a rash young man I have lost the money I owe you.
Her worthiness as a wife is well-known, and suitors come to her from all four corners of the world.

Ansari Begum has never denied that the petitioner was adopted by her and the same is not denied by her own son Ghulam rasool ; that moreover the adoption deed was never prepared by the petitioner or used and thus there is no question of forgery being committed by him ; that the entire case of the complainant is concocted and false and no offence is made out against the petitioner ; that the petitioner is a father of two children and his wife is pregnant and if the present bail is not granted to the petitioner it would adversely affect his family and his career .
The position in law is thus summarised in halsburv ' s Laws of England , Hailsham Edition , Vol . 22 , page 112 , para . 191 : " whether or not , in any given case , the relation of Master and servant , exists is a question of fact ; but in all cases the relation imports the existence of power in the employer not only to direct what work the servant is to do , but also the manner in which the work is to be done .

In a nutshell , these decisions have taken the view that the Constitution must be interpreted in the light of the common law , the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution , that the language of the Constitution cannot be understood without reference to the common law , that to determine the extent of the grants of power , the court must place itself in the position of the men who framed and ' adopted the Constitution and inquire what they must have understood to be the meaning and scope of those grants , that when a power is conferred to legislate on a particular topic it is important , in determining the scope of the power , to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embarced within that topic in legislative practice and particularly in the legislative practice of the state which has conferred that power , that the object of doing so is emphatically not to seek a pattern to which a due exercise of the power must conform , but to ascertain the general conception involved in the words of the Act , and finally , that Parliament must be presumed to have had Indian legislative practice in mind and unless the context otherwise clearly requires , not to have conferred a legislative power intended to be interpreted in a sense not understood by those to whom the Act was to apply .

It was strenuously argued by Mr. K. section Krishnaswami Iyengar that Lakshminarayana Iyer was a Brahmin gentleman presumably versed in the Sastras , living in a village in the southernmost part of the Madras State , that his idea of a restricted estate was more likely to be one analogous to a Hindu woman ' s estate than a life estate a , , understood in English law wherein the estate is measured by use and not by duration , and that if this will was construed in the light of the notions of Lakshminarayana Iyer it should be held that the widow got under it a Hindu widow ' s estate and the daughter got under it a contingent remainder in the nature of SPEs and on her death there was nothing which could devolve on the plaintiff and he thus had no locus standi to question the Alienations made by the widow , 856 the learned counsel in support of his contention drew our attention to a number of decisions of different high courts and contended that the words of this will should be construed in the manner as more or less similar words were construed by the courts in the Wills dealt with in those decisions .
We find that According to prosecution case occurrence took place in the intervening night of 30 / 31.5.1981 at about 1.30 a.m. when it is stated that the accused ghaseeta , Babua and Haidar had come to the house of Durjan in whose house the sister of informant was sleeping with the wife of Durjan and all these accused were armed with fire arm weapons and they entered the house after opening latch of the main door after inserting hands as the same was closed from in side and after opening the same , they tried to take away informant 's sister who raised alarm along with wife of Durjan who was also in side the house and upon the said alarm being raised , the informant , his wife , younger brother ( deceased ) reached the place of incident i.e. house of Durjan and saw that the accused were trying to forcibly take away the sister of the informant and having seen these persons , the accused left the sister of the informant and in stead took away / abducted the brother of the informant namely Ram Bharose who is stated by the prosecution to have been killed by the accused persons and thereafter he was burnt .
While negativing the contention founded on delay and the resultant effect on the order of detention , this court observed : " In this context we consider it necessary to emphasise that the question whether the representation 95 submitted by a detenu has been dealt with all reasonable promptness and diligence is to be decided not by the application of any rigid or inflexible rule or set formula nor by a mere arithmetical counting of dates , but by a careful scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of each case ; if on such examination it is found that there was any remissness , indifference or avoidable delay on the part of the Detaining Authority / State Government in dealing with the representation , the court will undoubtedly treat it as a factor vitiating the continued detention of the detenu ; on the other hand , if the Court is satisfied that the delay was occasioned not by any lack of diligence or promptness of attention on the part of the party concerned , but due to unavoidable circumstances or reasons entirely beyond his control , such delay will not be treated as furnishing a ground for the grant of relief to the detenu against his continued detention .

The principle has been summarised by Das J. ( as he then was ) at p . 725 , in these words : the principles , as I apprehend them are : ( i ) that if a statute empowers an authority , not being a court in the ordinary sense , to decide disputes arising out of a claim made by one party under the statute which claim is opposed by another party and to determine the respective rights of the contesting parties who are opposed to each other , there is a lis and prima facie and in the absence of anything in the statute to the contrary it is the duty of the Authority to act judicially and the decision of the Authority is a quasi judicial act ; and ( ii ) that if a statutory authority has power to do any act which will prejudicially affect the subject , then , although there are not two parties apart from the authority and the contest is between the authority proposing to do the act and the subject opposing it , the final determination of the authority will yet be a quasi judicial Act provided the authority is required by the statute to act judicially .

P.C. and despite finding that the accused in each case was allotted a quarter by the company for his use and occupation and each had no authority to retain possession of the same after he retired , and that the cause of action in each case arose when the accused failed to deliver possession of the quarter to the company , held that the documents produced by , the company did not disclose anything regarding the retirement of the accused from the service , but at the same time he recorded that during the course of Evidence P.W. 1 had deposed that each of the accused retired from service and immediately after the retirement failed to redeliver possession of the company ' s quarter which attracted section 630 ( l ) ( b ) OF THE and which was punishable only with fine and the complaint , therefore , ought to have been filed within six months from the date of retirement of the accused , and as the complaint was filed only during the year 1985 it was clearly barred by limitation , Wherefore , , the complaint could not be taken into consideration , and consequently , the accused was to be acquitted .

Deduction of tax on inter corporate dividends : where the total income of an assessee being a company includes any income by way of dividends received by it from an Indian company or a company which has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends ( including dividends on preference shares ) within India , the assessee shall be entitled to a deduction from the income tax with which it is chargeable on its total income for any assessment year of so much of the amount of income tax calculated at the average rate of income tax on the income so included ( other than any such income on which no income tax is payable under the provisions of this act ) as exceeds an amount of twenty five per cent thereon ; . " there were some amendments made in Section 85A by Finance Act , 1966 but they are not material for our present purpose and we need not refer to them .
According to him though section 9 refers to all agricultural income of Muslim trusts " referred to in section 3 of The Musalman Wakf Validating Act , 1913 , ( act VI of 1913 ) , the Wakfs contemplated by Section 3 of the said Act ( act VI of 1913 ) include not merely Wakf Alal Aulad but also other wakfs where property has been permanently dedicated for any purposes recognised by the Musalman law as religious , pious or charitable and this , he argued , becomes clear from sub clause ( a ) of section 3 which speaks of Wakf created by a Muslim for the maintenance and support wholly or partially of his family , children or descendants ; in other words , according to Mr. Mukherjee , Section 9 of the Act is not confined to Muslim trusts known as Wakf Alal Aulad but is applicable to all wakfs and , therefore , in case of Wakfs other than Wakf Alal Aulad the exemption granted by section 9 of the Act which is in respect of all agricultural income must be regarded as discriminatory as against the exemption granted by section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act .

But , according to the petitioners , this was not sufficient to wipe out the blemish in the process of selection for two reasons : firstly , because Shri R C. Marya and Shri Raghubar Dayal Gaur participated in the interviews of the other candidates and that gave rise to a reasonable apprehension in 683 the mind of the candidates that Shri R.C. Marya and Shri Raghubar Dayal Gaur might tend to depress the marks of the other candidates with a view to ensuring the selection of the candidates related to them and secondly , because there could be reasonable apprehension in the mind of the candidates that the other members of the Haryana Public Service Commission interviewing the candidates might , out of regard for their colleagues , tend to give higher marks to the candidates related to them , the argument of the petitioners was that the presence of Shri R.C. Marya and Shri Raghubar Dayal Gaur on The interviewing committee gave rise to an impression that there was reasonable likelihood of bias in favour of the three candidates related to Shri R.C. Marya and Shri Raghubar Dayal Gaur and this had the effect of vitiating the entire selection process .

By section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , it is enacted that certain offences amounting to contempt of lawful authority of public servants i.e. offences falling under Sections 172 to 188 i.p ; code , offences against public justice under sections 193 , 194 , 195 , 196 , 199 , 200 , 205 , 206 , 207 , 208 , 209 , 210 , 211 and 228 , when such offences are alleged to have been committed in or in relation to , any proceeding in any court , and offences described in section 463 or punishable under sections 471 , 475 or 476 , when such offences are alleged to have been committed by a party to any proceeding in any court in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in such proceeding , cannot be taken cognizance of by any court , except in the first class of cases on a complaint in writing of the public servant concerned , and in the second and third class of cases on the complaint in writing of such court or some other court to which it is subordinate .
On the other hand , for the respondents , it is contended that , in the decisions relied upon for the petitioners , the publications alleged to constitute contempt were of such a nature that they were seen to affect the course of actions actually pending in courts , that even otherwise the decision of ; the House of Lords has been widely criticised and should not be followed and that the views expressed by Lord Denning , M.R. in Attorney General Vs BBC , though reversed by the House of Lords in by the American courts in bridges Vs State of California , and in John D. Pennekamp vs Stale of Florida , ; should be preferred as more appropriate to present day conditions , particularly in the context of the PG No 237 freedom of press guaranteed under Act 19 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution of India , and also incorporated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , 1948 , Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights and Article 19 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights , 1966 .
In a still more recent case Dalip Singh vs State of Punjab ( 1 ) it was held by this court that an order of compulsory retirement of a public servant for administrative reasons under R. 278 of the Patiala State regulations which regulations did not fix the minimum age or length of service after which an order of compulsory retirement could be made , was not one of dismissal or removal from service within the meaning of Article 311 ( 2 ) of the Constitution , because retirement under a service rule which provided for compulsory retirement at any age irrespective of the length of service put in , cannot necessarily be regarded as dismissal or removal within the meaning of Article 311 , and the observations ( herein before quoted ) made by Venkatarama Aiyar , J. , in saubhagchand Doshi ' s case ( 2 ) were for the purposes of deciding that case obiter , and that it was not a general rule that an order of compulsory retirement not amounting to dismissal or removal can take place only under a rule fixing the age of compulsory retirement .

Addressing arguments on the present appeal , Ms. Sahila Lamba , counsel for the appellant submitted that the impugned judgment suffers from several infirmities and the trial court had gravely erred in convicting and sentencing the appellant ; that there was no independent public witness and the witnesses examined by the prosecution were interested witnesses who owed money to the appellant and that they had falsely implicated the appellant with their malafide intention to escape from returning the money borrowed by them ; that the above could be proved by the crl. a 765 / 2012 Page 3 of 18 unchallenged testimony of the Father of the appellant / dw - 1 ; that in the FSL report neither the presence of semen on the body of prosecutrix nor any blood of prosecutrix on the body of the appellant , had been detected , and therefore it did not support the case of the prosecution , thereby ruling out the possibility of commission of alleged offence by the appellant ; that there was considerable delay in registration of the FIR which casts a serious doubt on the veracity of case of prosecution .
A.498 / 2007 page 1 of 11 appellant under Section 374 ( 2 ) r / w 482 of the Code of Criminal procedure against the impugned judgment dated 18.07.2007 and order on sentence dated 31.7.2007 passed by Additional Sessions Judge Patiala House Courts , New Delhi , whereby the appellant was held guilty and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life with fine of Rs. 1,000 / - for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and in default of payment of fine simple imprisonment for a period of one month ; for the offence punishable under section 25 ( 1 b ) of the Arms Act , 1959 , the appellant was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year with fine of Rs. 1000 / - and in default of payment of fine simple imprisonment for a period of one month ; for the offence punishable under Section 27 of the arms Acts , 1959 , the appellant was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs. 1000 / - and in default of payment of fine simple imprisonment for one month .

It appears to us that the prescribed authority was clearly in error in so holding because the permission granted had not been exhausted because the suit as dismissed on a technical plea and not on the merit of the contentions reference may be made to the observations in the decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of pahlad Das vs Ganga Saran and another , AIR 1958 Allahabad 774 , where the Division Bench of that Court held that the obvious purpose of the permission under Section 3 of the old Act was to enable the plaintiff , the landlord to evict the tenant from the premises and as long as that purpose was not fulfilled , the permission could not obviously exhaust itself where it was not shown that the permission was granted to file a single suit or that it had been specified in IT that a second suit could not be filed , the permission could not exhaust itself simply because the first suit filed on its basis was dismissed on some technical ground and the permission obtained could be availed of for filing the second suit .

In J. Jayalalitha v. Union of India [ ( 1999 ) 5 SCC 138 ] , the constitution of Special Courts under the Prevention of Corruption Act was challenged and so also the appointment of Special Judges under section 3 ( 1 ) of P.C. Act for trying a case or group of cases within the particular area was challenged and the Hon 'ble Supreme Court of India in the light of the specific provision under section 3 ( 1 ) Of The P.C. Act held that the government has power to appoint special judge to try a particular case or group of cases , but in the case on hand , this Court has pointed out that for registering , investigating and trying the cases under Sections 447 , 420 and 506 ( ii ) IPC and other offences , the regular courts are conferred with jurisdiction to try those cases and also placed reliance upon the observations made in para 62 of Anwar Ali Sarkar case and held that registering cases and investigating it in respect of offenders , namely land grabbers is wholly arbitrary and not proper classification .
It is true that Dr. Nirankar Singh ( p.w. 4 ) , who performed the autopsy on the corpse of Gyasuddin , in his examination - in - chief , did not state that the injuries suffered by Gyasuddin were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death but in our view this would make no difference because the Supreme Court in the oft - quoted case of Brij Bhukhan v. State of U.P. reported in AIR 1957 SC 474: 1957 Cri LJ 591 , in para 6 has laid down the ratio that if a bare perusal of the injuries makes it manifest that they are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death , then the absence of the medical evidence to the said effect would be no impediment in the way of Court in recording a conviction for the offence punishable under Section 302 , I.P.C. in our judgement , a perusal of injury No. 3 suffered by Gyasuddin , coupled with the internal damage beneath it , makes it manifest that it was sufficient to cause his death in ordinary course of nature .

For ascertaining the real intention of the legislature , the Court may consider , inter alia , the nature and the design of the statute , and the consequences which would follow from constituting it one way or the other , 1079 the impact of other provisions whereby the necessity of complying with the provisions in question is avoided , the circumstances , namely , that the statute provides for a contingency of the non compliance with the provisions , the fact that the non compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty , the serious or trivial consequences that flow therefrom , and , above all , whether the object of the legislation will be defeated or furthered . " thus two considerations for regarding a provision as directory are : ( 1 ) absence of any provision for the contingency of a particular provision not being complied with or followed and ( 2 ) serious General inconvenience and prejudice that would result to the general public if the act of the Government or an instrumentality is declared invalid for non compliance with the particular provision .

Mr. Manchanda invited attention to the following observation in zaverbhai amaidas Vs The State of Bombay ( 1 ) " it is true , as already pointed out , that on a question under article 254 ( 1 ) whether an Act of Parliament prevails against a law of the state , no question of repeal arises ; but the principle on which the rule of implied repeal rests , namely , that if the subject matter of the later legislation is identical with that of the earlier , so that they cannot both stand together , then the earlier is repealed by the later enactment will be equally applicable to a question under article 254 ( 2 ) whether the Further legislation by Parliament is in 384 respect of the same matter as that of the state law . ' there is no question of placing the later law , defence of India Act , 1971 , for consideration by the President under article 254 ( 2 ) of the Constitution for both the laws , the and defence of India Act , 1971 are laws passed by Parliament .

As early ( 1 ) ; , 722 23 . 63 as 1880 , the Bombay High Court had held in Rai Manekbai vs manekji kavasji ( 1 ) , that art 181 only relates to applications under the Code of Civil Procedure in which case no period of limitation has been prescribed for the application , and the consensus of judicial opinion on this point had been noticed by the Privy Council in Hansraj Gupta vs Official Liquidators , Dehra Dun Mussoorie Electric Tramway Company Ltd . ( 2 ) an attempt was no doubt made in the case of Sha Mulchand & Co . Ltd. vs Jawahar Mills Ltd . ( ) to suggest that the amendment of article 158 and 178 ipso facto altered the meaning which had been attached to the words in Article 181 by judicial decisions , but this attempt failed , because this court held ' that the long catena of decisions under Article 181 may well be said to have , as it were , added the words " U nder the code " in the first column of that article ' .

On appeal , the learned Division Bench by an elaborate and erudite judgment dismissed the appeal holding , inter alia , that in the facts and circumstances of the case it could not be held that the trial court erred in exercising its discretion to decide the controversy , namely , whether the contract being void the arbitration clause also was void , in the application without evidence and on the basis of pleadings only , nor was the discretion exercised improp erly ; that the learned Judge was not wrong in coming to the conclusion that the mistake as pleaded as to quality of the goods was not a mistake of such nature as to make the thing contracted for something different , and in holding that there was no case of mutual mistake of such a type as to quality of the thing contracted for which could have avoided the parent contract which contained the arbitration clause ; and that the learned single Judge was right in so far as he held that the matters were arbitrable apart from the question of illegality of the contract .

In support of the appeal the learned Solicitor General submitted three points before us : ( 1 ) that as the cause of action of the plaintiff is based on the delayed delivery which arose at the most on January 1 , 1962 , the case of the plaintiff is covered by the provisions of the new Railways Act as amended by Act 39 of 1961 , which is an exhaustive code in itself providing a self contained machinery in order to determine the liability of the Railways and as the conditions mentioned in Section 76 of the Railways Act have not been fulfilled the plaintiff is not entitled to any decree ; ( 2 ) that at any rate since the plaintiff has claimed interest as damages , in the absence of any agreement providing for such an interest , the plaintiff ' s claim is not actionable at law ; and 508 ( 3 ) that the plaintiff could not claim for loss of profit or loss of market as the same is expressly barred by section 78 ( d ) of the new Railways Act .
In the first place Counsel for the petitioners have contended that under section 30 ( 2 ) of the principal Act of 1910 prior to its amendment by U.P. ordinance No. 4 of 1979 and U.P. Act 13 of 1979 it was open to the respondents to adopt either one or the other method of granting FL 2 licences and determine the licence fee payable by the grantee accordingly , that is to say the respondents could grant the licence either by auction or by calling tenders " and once a particular mode was adopted it was incumbent upon them to apply the same for the purpose of determining the sum payable by the grantee ; in other words the contention has been that it was not open to them to adopt a combination of two or more methods and claim " assessed fee " in addition to " fixed fee " and therefore the instant attempt on the part of the respondents to levy and recover the " assessed fee " in addition to " fixed fee " would be illegal and without authority of law .

If the preliminary objection was not entertained and a decision reached thereupon , further proceedings taken in the election petition would mean a full fledged trial involving examination of a large number of witnesses on behalf of the 2nd Respondent in support of the numerous allegations of corrupt practices attributed by him to the appellant , his agents or others working on his behalf ; examination of a large number of witnesses by or on behalf of the appellant controverting the allegations made against him ; examination of witnesses in support of the recrimination submitted by the appellant against the 2nd respondent ; and large 384 number of visits by the appellant from distant places like Delhi and Bombay to Ranchi result ing in not only heavy expenses and loss of time and diversion of the appellant from his public duty in the various fields of activity including those in the House of the people : it would mean unnecessary harassment and expenses for the appellant which could certainly be avoided if the preliminary objection urged by him was decided at the initial stage by the Election Tribunal .

crl.l. p. 564 / 2015 Page 3 of 10 and discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses led by the prosecution , however , there are no material contradictions or improvements in the testimonies which go to the root of the case ; that the learned trial court failed to appreciate that so far as the nature of injuries on the body of the deceased / Rajiv were concerned , same had been duly proved through the post-mortem report ; that the deceased died due to shock as a result of a head injury due to blunt object and the testimonies of pw1 , pw2 , pw3 and pw4 are clear and consistent to the effect that the deceased died due to the injuries made by the accused persons ; that the learned trial court failed to take notice of the disclosure statement of the accused persons which led to the recovery of the alleged weapon of offence ; that for the above reasons , the Additional Public Prosecutor for the state strongly urged for grant of leave to appeal to challenge the impugned judgment of acquittal .

 The utter disregard shown by the Magistrate to the nature of the offences , particularly the one under Section 304 A I.P.C. , and the sentences provided for them under the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act , by imposing what may be termed as ' flea bite ' sentences on the respondent , should have spurred the High Court to not only pass appro priate strictures against the magistrate but also to set right matters by enhancing the sentence at least for the conviction under Section 304 A I.P.C. to a conscionable level in exercise of its powers under Section 377 I.P.C. 1107 the High Court has failed to comprehend that the RE spondent has been let off with a total fine of rs. 345 for his convictions under all the five charges relating to the death of one person and the Sustainment of injuries by another due to his rash and negligent driving besides his failure to secure medical assistance to the victims as well as his failure to make a report to the authorities about the accident .

The contention is that in the case of a deferred annuity policy the Annuitant , on payment of a lumpsum gets the right to the annuity equivalent in the shape of deferred H annual or monthly payments guaranteed for a certain period ( in 574 the instant case for 35 years ) , that there is a date on which the annuity vests in the Annuitant ( here 22.1.1964 ) , that usually there is a provision that in the event of the death of the annuitant before the date of vesting the single premium paid by him would be returned to the proposer , and that the proposer may have ( as is the case here ) the option , to be exercised before the date on which the annuity vests , to receive the commuted value in lieu of deferred annual or monthly payments and such provisions clearly show that the intention is that in essence the annuity contract IS operative from the date on which the annuity vests and thereafter there is no element of insurance in the contract .
When a return of the income is made for the relevant year , it is a return with regard to the total income of the firm that has to be submitted under section 22 ; and when assessment is levied under Section 23 , the Income Tax Officer determines and can determine the total income of each partner of the firm only after ascertaining the total income of the firm itself it is true that section 23 ( 5 ) as it then stood required the Income Tax Officer to determine the total income of each partner of the firm including his share of the firm ' s income and to assess each partner in respect of such income , and in that sense individual partners of the firm undoubtedly became liable to pay income tax ; but it is clear that in determining the total income of each partner his share in the firm ' s income has to be included and so the firm does not cease to be an assessee for the purpose of section 23 ( 5 ) .

In bignold vs Giles . ( 3 ) ' annuity ' is described thus : " an annuity is a right to receive de Anno in annum a certain sum ; that may be given for life , or for a series of years it may be given during any particular period , or in perpetuity ; and there is also this singularity about annuities , that although payable out of the personal assets , they are capable of being given for the purpose of devolution , as real estate ; they may be given to a man and his heirs , and may go to the heir as real estate ; so an annuity may be given to a man and the heirs of his body ; that does not , it is true , constitute an estate tail , but that is by reason of the statute de Donis , which contains only the word ' tenements ' and an annuity , though a hereditament , is not a tenement ; and an annuity so given is a base fee .
Now if this contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General were well founded , it would become almost impossible to enforce the provisions of the because in every case where bonded labourers are sought to be identified for the purpose of release and rehabilitation under the provisions of the Act , the State authorities as also the employer would be entitled to insist that the bonded labourers must first prove that they are providing forced labour in consideration of an advance or other economic consideration received by them and then only they would be eligible of the benefits provided under the Act and this would make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for the labourers to establish that they are bonded labourers because they would have no evidence at all to prove that any advance or economic consideration was provided to them by the employer and since employment of bonded labourers is a penal offence under the Act the employer would immediately , without any hesitation , disown having given any advance or economic 131 consideration to the bonded labourers .

But on an overall consideration of the entire material on record and the evidence in the case in the light of the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties I am of the opinion that the appreciation of the evidence of p.ws. 1 , 10 and 11 by the learned Sessions Judge and the learned Judges of the High Court in so far as the appellants Sunil Kumar and Ved Prakash are concerned is correct and that the evidence of p.ws. 1 and 10 proves beyond reasonable doubt that these two appellants Sunil Kumar and Ved Prakash attacked the deceased Prakash Chandra and Umesh Chandra with knives as a result of which both of them , who had no weapons died on the spot , and the evidence of p.ws. 10 and 11 proves satisfactorily and beyond any reasonable doubt that these two appellants attacked P.W. 11 with knives with such intention that if he had died as a result of the injuries sustained by him they would be guilty of murder in furtherance of their common intention to murder .
At the same time pw6 Divya is tutored by pw4 Babita , who is her ' bua ' and when pw6 was subjected to cross examination , she deposed that on 01.06.2007 , her bua visited her house and thereafter , she had come on 05.06.2007 and also submitted that if pw4 Babita did not go to the house of this pw6 on 03.06.2007 then , the entire story of the prosecution is proved to be false , as pw4 has deposed that on 03.06.2007 , she visited house of her brother Raj Kumar and found police personnel circulating pamphlets regarding recovery of a torso and she also alleged to have identified the torso of her deceased brother Raj Kumar on 03.06.2007 and pw4 during her cross examination has failed to tell the colour of the undergarments of the deceased , so , the testimonies of pw4 , pw6 & pw10 are found to be inconsistent and that since the testimonies of the prosecution are found to be inconsistent with each other , thus , accused Kanwar Singh cannot be convicted .
Turning now to the last of the contentions of the appellant ' s counsel viz. that by reason of the respondents having agreed to take limited tenancy rights under the order of the Rent Controller for a period of two years commencing from 1.3.1976 they must be deemed to have impliedly surrendered their earlier tenancy rights as envisaged under clause ( f ) of Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act , it has no merit in it because , the High Court has rightly pointed out after referring to does d . Earl of egrement vs Courtenay , and some decisions of the High Courts , that when a new lease does not pass are interest according to the contract the acceptance of it will not operate as a surrender of the former lease ; that , in the case of a surrender implied by law from the acceptance of a new lease , the condition ought also to be understood as implied by law , making void the surrender in case the new lease should be made void .

Counsel for the petitioners contends , ( 1 ) that the persons summoned by the lieutenant governor by his notification dated July 7 , 1954 , could not constitute a Legislature of the new state as those persons were not elected or nominated in the manner prescribed by article 240 of the constitution ; and the parliament could dot by law validate acts and proceedings of that body which had no authority to legislate , ( 2 ) the Parliament in enacting the Validating 760 act had no authority retrospectively to form a Legislative Assembly in violation of the terms of article 240 of the Constitution especially when the new state of Himachal Pradesh which was formed under Act 32 of 1954 had ceased to exist at the date when the Abolition Act was enacted , and ( 3 ) even if the Validating Act is not open to challenge , the Abolition Act contravened Article 31 of the Constitution and is therefore void as infringing the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Article 19 and Article 31 of the Constitution .

We need not go into all the diverse contentions raised before the High Court as counsel for the appellant raised before us the following three questions only ( 1 ) that while making the , assessment the procedure contemplated by sections 127 , 129 ( c ) of the Act and RR . 9 to 20 of the taxation rules was not cornplied with inasmuch as no ward assessment books were maintained , and consequently , the entries therein were not authenticated as required by r . 19 ; ( 2 ) that section 129 suffers from the vice of excessive delegation of legislative powering as the act fails to provide either the maximum rate leviable by the corporation or the guidelines for levying the tax ; ( 3 ) that in any view of the matter , in the circumstances in which the resolution raising the rate was passed , it did not impose the enhanced rate on the property of the appellant as the same was , not , prior to April 1961 ' subjected to the u.i.p. tax .

In other words , the confidentiality , rather than serve any purpose of the Act goes to defeat it firstly by making the functioning of the system dependent entirely on the staff , and , secondly by making process under regulations 102 ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 104 ) ( 1 ) ineffective for want of assistance of the examine himself . " in making the above observations , the high court has ignored the cardinal principle that it is not within the legitimate domain of the court to determine whether the purpose of a statute can be served better by adopting any policy different from what has been laid down by the Legislature or its delegate and to strike down as unreasonable a bye law ( assuming for the purpose of discussion that the impugned regulation is a bye law ) merely on the ground that the policy enunciate therein does not meet with the approval of 57 the Court in regard to its efficaciousness for implementation of the object and purposes of the Act .

This Court held that the expression ' sale of goods ' was , at the time when the Government of India Act , 1935 was enacted , a term of well recognised legal import in the general law relating to sale of goods and in the legislative practice relating to that topic and must be interpreted as having the same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act 1930 : in the course of the judgment , Venkatarama Aiyar , J , WHO , spoke for the Court after examining the various decisions cited at the Bar , observed , As follows : " Thus , according to the law both of England and of India , in order to constitute a sale it is necessary that there should be an agreement between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to goods which of course pre supposes capacity to contract , that it must be supported by money consideration and that as a result of the transaction property must actually pass in the goods .
In support of these appeals Counsel for the appellants has contended that it was well settled that even while making a best judgment assessment the Income Tax Officer must make an honest and fair estimate of the income of the assessee and that having regard to the terms and conditions of the contract ( a specimen whereof was produced during the hearing before us ) and particularly the terms on which the stores / materials were supplied by the military authorities to the assessee for being used in the works undertaken by the firm , it was clear that no element of profit was embedded led in such stores / materials that were made available to the contractor for being used in the works entrusted lo the contractor and as such the cost or value of such stores / material could not be added to the total cash payments received by the contractor from the department under the contract for the purpose of estimating the income or profits derived by the contractor from such contract .

No. 295 of 2013 also asking the deceased to marry some other person if she is in any urgency and accordingly , on seeing the abovesaid utterance of the accused , as rightly put forth by the Public Prosecutor when the deceased had directly heard about the accused disowning her as well as the baby she had conceived through the accused openly , unable to digest the same and in such view of the matter , it is seen that the deceased had gone to the extent of committing suicide and resultantly rushed upstairs and poured kerosene on her body and set fire to herself and died thereby .
Lastly , it was contended that in any event the impugned order can be said to be a procedural or technical irregularity which has caused no prejudice to the petitioner - accused and there has not been any miscarriage of justice since the petitioner had appeared before the trial court in response to the summoning order and had never challenged that summoning order on the ground that he being not a public servant could not be summoned for the offences under sections 7 and ( 13 ) ( d ) of the Act of 1988 and that he did not do since he being a practicing advocate very well knew that there were allegations against him that he was in conspiracy with his co-accused police officials for extorting huge amount of money from the complainant whose father was in deep trouble being arrested in a murder case and so absence of sections of conspiracy , extortion etc. in the order dated 22nd April , 2009 did not amount to his implied discharge of those offences .

 In view of the fact that the members of the Committee themselves felt that the legal issues involved in the actual taking over of  Federal " subjects in the states by the Centre constituted a difficult subject on which they were not qualified to offer competent advice and their further statement that they were merely endeavouring to indicate the main features of what they considered to be required in order to establish " continuity of proceedings " , it has been argued before us on behalf of the Income Tax authorities that it would be wrong to treat the recomendations as binding statutory rules , even though the financial agreement between the High Contracting Parties States generally that the recommendations are accepted ; it is contended that the committee in express terms states that the recommendations merely endeavour to indicate the main features of what the committee thought was required , and they should not be placed on a pedestal higher than what the committee itself did .
4 . The learned counsel appearing for the revision petitioner as well as the Learned Government Advocate ( criminal side ) appearing for the appellant argued that the trial court erred in acquitting the accused from the charges levelled against them and the trial court has not taken into consideration the evidence of pw1 , who clearly stated about the facts of the case and also the involvement of the respondents / accused in this case and the evidence of pw2 , reveals the overt - acts committed by the accused on him and the trial court has not taken into consideration the evidence of medical officer ( pw10 ) who had treated Madasamy , issued Wound Certificate and also deposed about the injuries sustained by the said Madasamy and the reasons given by the trial judge in acquitting the accused are against the evidence , both oral and documentary available on record and hence , the Criminal Revision as well as the criminal appeal have to be allowed .
He had little chance of success . " 498 Issue No. 1 ( a ) ( iii ) was also decided against the respondent and it was held : " though the petitioner ' s deposition in this behalf is based only on the information furnished by the other witnesses whose evidence has already been discussed , the other evidence discussed above clearly establishes that koyi Mohana Rao , Karnam nayudarnma , Karanam Balaram , Karanam ankamm , R.W. 13 , Ravipudi Venkatadri , b.p.r. Vittal , chunduri Radhakrishna Murty , muddana madann Mohana Rao , parvathareddy Narasimha Rao , Munsif of sobhirala and his sons , Satyam , sriramnlu his grandson Ghanta Subbayya and thummalapenta venka taswamy , Narahari Venkata Subbarao and Thummala penta Venkateswarlu and some other people of Chirala and other villages over 100 in number pelted stones and disturbed the voters in the queues at the polling booths of Chinna Ganjam as a result of which polling was suspended from 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m .
The contents of the government orders of 1955 and 1958 referred to above are to be considered with the facts that Mian Lal Din and his ancestor possessed the land in their individual capacity ; that the government repelled the claim of Mian Lal Din for additional grant of land on the simple ground that the land already granted to him was costlier than the land which he held in possession ; that there was no intention on the part of the Government to dedicate the land to the Ziarat out of any pious intention ; that it was a sort of bargain between Mian Lal Din , the father of the defendants and the Government where under the land measuring 74 kanals was parted within the proprietary rights by the Government in consideration of Lal Din ' s Having abandoned possession of over 400 kanals of land ; the fact that the committee plaintiff also treated the grant in favour of Lal Din as is evident from Ext .
Lastly , it was held by the learned Judge that , since under the provisions of the impugned resolution the deemed date of appointment of a promotee depends upon two factors , namely , his inter se seniority amongst the persons who have been promoted from his department and his continuous service in the clerical cadre minus two years , it is inevitable that whenever a person from some other department is taken on promotion to the BRO , the deemed date of appointment of persons drawn earlier from the same department is likely to get altered and since in consequence thereof the deemed dates of the direct recruits will also undergo a change , the seniority of the direct recruits is made dependant on uncertain events which has no reasonable nexus with the object and purpose of the rules and the rule has therefore to be struck down as arbitrary and violative of the principles of equality of opportunity enshrined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution .
For the foregoing , we are of the view that though generally speaking , the benefit of sections 3 , 4 and 6 of the Probation of Offenders Act , 1958 which , as observed by Subba Rao , J.

Given that the process to obtain a lemma from an inflected word can be explained by looking at its morphosyntactic category , including fine - grained morphosyntactic information to train contextual lemmatizers has become common practice , without considering whether that is the optimum in terms of downstream performance .
By deploying several automated metrics , each grounded in different aspects of empathy , we identified multiple areas in which current systems could be improved , and uncovered behaviors that have gone undetected with previous evaluations , such as the lack of specificity , reflection levels , and diversity .
Moreover , the experiments reveal the superiority of the Hyperbolic word embeddings over the Euclidean counterparts and demonstrate that the multirelational approach can obtain competitive results when compared to state - of - the - art neural models , with the advantage of being intrinsically more efficient and interpretable
To overcome the systematic problems of using formal language for inductive reasoning , we propose a new paradigm ( task ) of inducing natural language rules from natural language facts , and correspondingly propose a dataset DEER and new evaluation metrics for this task .
Moreover , our experiments suggest that the best lemmatizers out - of - domain are those using simple UPOS tags or those trained without morphology and , lastly , that current evaluation practices for lemmatization are not adequate to clearly discriminate between models .
In our future work , we aim to run experiments via the OpenAI API to see the impact of leaked test data on the performance of GPT - 3.5 and GPT - 4 on the leaked datasets and the tasks in general .
Furthermore , it is perhaps a good time to propose an alternative word - level metric to evaluate lemmatization that , complemented with sentence accuracy , may provide a more realistic view of the performance of contextual lemmatizers .
In this work , we conduct the first systematic analysis of work using OpenAI ’s GPT - 3.5 and GPT - 4 , the most prominently used LLMs today , in the context of data contamination .
We also notice that the Spearman correlation test used in Figure 5 may not be well - suited for such noisy observations , as the high p - value of the GPT - 2 model shows .
Existing methods for factuality evaluation of LLM generation focus on facts sampled from the LM itself , and thus do not control the set of evaluated facts and might under- represent domain specific or rare facts .
2 . The embeddings obtained in this work are contextualizable ( by means of a relation - adjusted transformation ) , but are not contextualized , i.e. , they are not dependent on surrounding text .
We think this benchmark is a valuable addition to the text segmentation landscape as larger - scale , non-synthetic benchmarks are scarce , and previous research focused primarily on well - structured , homogeneous documents .
However , formal language can cause systematic problems for inductive reasoning such as disability of handling raw input such as natural language , sensitiveness to mislabeled data , and incapacity to handle ambiguous input .
Furthermore , and unlike the vast majority of previous work , we also evaluate lemmatizers in out - of - domain settings , which constitutes , after all , their most common application use .
That is , while our survey methodology may be suitable to discuss and uncover various limitations of current systems and their evaluation procedures , we do not show its suitability for future evaluations .
Furthermore , we consider investigating indirect data leakage in other closed - source models , namely from Anthropic or Cohere , which appeared in a small number of papers reviewed in this work .
With DEER , we investigate a modern approach for inductive reasoning where we use natural language as representation for knowledge instead of formal language and use pretrained language models as “ reasoners ” .
Furthermore , and in contrast to previous work , we also evaluate lemmatizers in an out - of - domain setting , which constitutes , after all , their most common application use .
We hypothesize that a revision of the self - attention operation could help reduce anisotropy by facilitating the emergence of sharp attention softmax distributions without distorting the geometry of the hidden representations .
However , prior works over - rely on task - specific demonstration of tool use that limits their generalizability and computational cost due to making many calls to large - scale LLMs .
( H - UDM ) approach , the hierarchical extension of Lian et al. ( 2023c ) that addresses both disfluency transcription and detection to eliminate the need for extensive manual annotation .
This work examines comparative assessment from multiple perspectives : performance compared to absolute grading ; positional biases in the prompt ; and efficient ranking in terms of the number of comparisons .
We also propose a new framework drawing insights from philosophy literature for this task , which we show in the experiment section that surpasses baselines in both automatic and human evaluations .
Our evaluation shows that Archer challenges the capabilities of current state - of - the - art models , with a high - ranked model on the Spider leaderboard achieving only
Blindly relying only on automated metrics in applications of such systems , especially in a sensitive domain like healthcare and the mental health domain , can carry risks as well .
We also propose a new framework , drawing insights from philosophical literature , which , as shown in the experimental section , surpasses baselines in both automatic and human evaluations .
FACTOR focuses on evaluation over a controlled set of facts , we see these two approaches as complementary ; together , they yield a more holistic assessment of LM factuality .
We introduce GEAR , a computationally efficient query - tool grounding algorithm that is generalizable to various tasks that require tool use while not relying on task - specific demonstrations .
The task aims to segment unstructured content , in particular speech , conversations , and transcriptions , in a linear sequence of chapters and provides each chapter with a title .
n this paper , we introduce GEAR : a generalizable query - tool grounding algorithm that enables efficient tool groundings without extra fine - tuning or task - specific demonstrations .
In this paper , we present Archer , a complex bilingual text - to - SQL dataset with three distinct reasoning types : arithmetic , commonsense , and hypothetical reasoning .
1 . The automatic semantic role labeling process is not 100 % accurate , and thus is a limiting factor in analysing the impact of this information on the models .
However , prior research in this area has been constrained by limited datasets , which are either small in scale , synthesized , or only contain well - structured documents .
Experiment results show consistent performance gains in seven translation directions , which provide further support for our conclusions and understanding of the role of monolingual data in machine translation .
Fixing this limitation is possible in future work , but it will require the non-trivial ability to disambiguate the terms appearing in the definitions ( i.e. , definiens ) .
In NLP , it takes the form of anisotropy , a singular property of hidden representations which makes them unexpectedly close to each other in terms of angular distance.
This is accomplished by introducing a fine - grained scoring mechanism that leverages both semantic and pattern similarities and leveraging smaller language models for query - tool grounding .
At the same time , we document a number of evaluation malpractices emerging in the reviewed papers , such as unfair or missing baseline comparisons and reproducibility issues .
We show in this paper that anisotropy can also be observed empirically in language models with specific objectives that should not suffer directly from the same consequences .
Llama2-chat , comparative assessment is superior to prompt scoring , and in many cases can achieve performance competitive with state - of - the - art methods .
We also provide empirical evidence that anisotropy appears as an inherent property of latent distributions used in the self - attention mechanism when modeling sharp attention patterns .
However , the manner in which these methods contribute to the success of machine translation tasks and how they can be effectively combined remains an under-researched area .
4 . The multi-relational embeddings presented in the paper were initialised from scratch in order to test their efficiency in capturing the semantic structure of dictionary definitions .
We conclude that anisotropy almost systematically affects Transformers on all modalities , in a way that is not always correlated with the drift of the representations .
An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that the framework can help imposing the desired structural constraints while preserving the semantic mapping required for controllable and interpretable traversal .
Lemmatization is a natural language processing ( NLP ) task that consists of producing , from a given inflected word , its canonical form or lemma .
In this work , we present our findings based on the analysis of 255 papers evaluating the performance of GPT - 3.5 and GPT - 4 .
For instance , the selection of factual completions is straightforward in knowledge - intensive domains , where nearly every sentence in the corpus contains factual information .
While some researchers have noted limitations , e.g. , that these systems tend to generate generic utterances , no study has systematically verified these issues .
We present Archer , a challenging bilingual text - to - SQL dataset specific to complex reasoning , including arithmetic , commonsense and hypothetical reasoning .
We see our work also as a stepping stone to support even more unstructured content and speech in a broader scope , such as meetings .
Our findings inform the design of more effective pipelines for leveraging monolingual data in extremely low - resource and low - resource machine translation tasks .
Our results empirically demonstrate that informing lemmatizers with fine - grained morphological features during training is not that beneficial , not even for agglutinative languages .
However , we stress that when deploying such models in sensitive settings , automatic evaluations may not be sufficient , and human evaluation is required .
In fact , modern contextual word representations seem to implicitly encode enough morphological information to obtain competitive contextual lemmatizers without seeing any explicit morphological signal .
In fact , modern contextual word representations seem to implicitly encode enough morphological information to obtain good contextual lemmatizers without seeing any explicit morphological signal .
Our experimental findings serve as clear evidence of the effectiveness and reliability of the methods we have introduced , encompassing both transcription and detection tasks .
It turns out that providing lemmatizers with fine - grained morphological features during training is not that beneficial , not even for agglutinative languages .
Moreover , we provide the first and comprehensive analysis of how well pretrained language models can induce natural language rules from natural language facts .
Therefore , there is an open question regarding the possible benefits of initialising the models with pre-trained distributional embeddings such as Word2Vec and Glove .
GEAR achieves higher precision in tool grounding compared to prior strategies using LLM prompting , thus improving downstream accuracy at a reduced computational cost .
We find that language models remain sensitive to specific inputs and surface features even as they scale to hundreds of billions of parameters .
Some recent works tend to show that anisotropy is a consequence of optimizing the cross-entropy loss on long - tailed distributions of tokens .
We acknowledge that evaluating empathy is difficult , and that a survey of recent systems is different from a proposal for future evaluations .
Prior works used perplexity , which may be affected by factors other than factual knowledge and does not contrast facts with false statements .
An additional analysis looking at specific lemma classes ( SES ) has shown that many common word forms are still not properly predicted .
In this survey , we discuss over 250 recent studies of English language model behavior before task - specific fine - tuning .
Then , we analyze the impact of Pre-Training , Back - Translation , and Multi-Task Learning on translation tasks of various sizes .
We discuss the challenge of preventing data contamination and ensuring fair model evaluation in the age of closed and continuously trained models .
Most critically , studies tend to rely on a single non-reproducible empathy score , which inadequately reflects the multidimensional nature of empathy .
Additionally , they overlook the problem of indirect data leaking , where models are iteratively improved by using data coming from users .
LLM , respectively ; while leveraging semantic and pattern - based evaluation at both question and answer levels for generalizable tool grounding .
Finally , good out - of - domain performance can be achieved using simple UPOS tags or without any explicit morphological signal .
For instance , we don’t prove that sharp self - attention patterns cannot emerge without anisotropy in keys and queries representations .
Our experiments show that FACTOR ranks models differently than perplexity and is more aligned with factuality in open - ended generation .
Results show that multi-task fine - tuning further improves both the extremely low - resource task and low - resource tasks .
FACTOR allows automatic evaluation of factuality , which can be used to efficiently measure and develop methods for mitigating these risks .
Language Models ( LLMs ) , with some of the most popular ones being either fully or partially closed - source .
Experimental results on Archer , obtained from both LLMs and fine - tuned models , suggest plenty of space for improvement .
Transformer language models have received widespread public attention , yet their generated text is often surprising even to NLP researchers .
We provide the first and comprehensive analysis of PLM ’s ability to induce natural language rules from natural language facts .
We use our framework to create three benchmarks : Wiki - FACTOR , News - FACTOR and Expert - FACTOR .
In this article we provide an in - depth study on the role of morphological information to learn contextual lemmatizers .
Moreover , they indicate that incorporating negative examples into training sets might also help optimizing models to be more factual .
Moreover , the generation of non-factual completions is based on a prompted model , specifically designed for the Wikipedia domain .
Finally , informed by our analysis , we detailed some suggested practices for the evaluation of closed - source LLMs .
For example , content creators , podcasters , and educators could use it to structure their content for their audience .
Bee was not conscious , because she was ashamed of the reality ; to which men have given a bad name , calling it Satan ; and so it has to steal into the garden of paradise in the guise of a snake , and whisper secrets into the ears of man 's chosen consort and make her rebellious ; then farewell to all ease ; and after that comes death !
This malady of ideas which afflicts me is shaping my life within : nevertheless a great part of my life remains outside its influence ; and so there is set up a discrepancy between my outward life and its inner design which I try my best to keep concealed even from myself ; otherwise it may wreck not only my plans , but my very life .
If , thought I to myself , as I lay out there , I had to steal these stars one by one , like golden coins , for my country -- these stars so carefully stored up in the bosom of the darkness -- then the sky would be blinded , the night widowed for ever , and my theft would rob the whole world .
After finishing the day 's work and taking my afternoon bath , I would do up my hair and renew my vermilion mark and put on my sari , carefully crinkled ; and then , bringing back my body and mind from all distractions of household duties , I would dedicate it at this special hour , with special ceremonies , to one individual .
He begged and prayed Harish Kundu , his zamindar , to let him sell off his stock , bought with borrowed money , promising faithfully never to do it again ; but the zamindar would not hear of it , and insisted on his burning the foreign stuff there and then , if he wanted to be let off .
19 . Sakuntala , after the king , her lover , went back to his kingdom , promising to send for her , was so lost in thoughts of him , that she failed to hear the call of her hermit guest who thereupon cursed her , saying that the object of her love would forget all about her .
Sometimes conflicts of worldly interests roused suspicions and jealousies , making breaches in our love ; and when the Chota Rani came in between us , these breaches seemed as if they would never be mended , but it always turned out that the healing forces at bottom proved more powerful than the wounds on the surface .
Thus we came to cherish the belief that our history needed no steed , but that like heaven 's chariot it would move with its own inherent power -- At least no wages would have to be paid to the charioteer ; only his wine cup would have to be filled again and again .
And therefore , so long as we dance frantic dances on our temple pavements , smeared with their blood , their severed heads carried on our shoulders , religion will only laugh at us if we quarrel with Mussulmans in her name , and nothing but the quarrel itself will remain true .
The stores seemed short , and pilfering must have been going on of late , but I could not muster up the courage to take any particular person to task -- for might not the thought have crossed somebody 's mind : " Where were your eyes all these days ! "
There is just this one little altar of worship which has kept its head above the all - pervading depths of my dishonour , and so I want to cleave to it night and day ; for on which ever side I step away from it , there is only emptiness .
But the man who loves the fish wants to enjoy it in the water ; and if that is impossible he waits on the bank ; and even if he comes back home without a sight of it he has the consolation of knowing that the fish is all right .
Those who are masters in the art , advertise the biggest lies in their business , enter false accounts in their political ledgers with their broadest - pointed pens , launch their newspapers daily laden with untruths , and send preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood like flies carrying pestilential germs .
I came back into the bedroom where my husband was asleep , closing my eyes as I passed through , and went off to the open terrace beyond , on which I lay prone , clasping to my breast the end of the sari tied over the gold .
Holy Fire , it goes on to say , has been aroused to its sacred function of purifying the country ; and other agencies are also at work to see that those who are not true sons of the motherland do cease to encumber her lap .
I would have preferred not to discuss the matter of the key in the Bara Rani 's presence , but as soon as she saw Bimal , she asked her : " Do you know , dear , where the key of the safe is ? "
Vaishnava and modern English , accompanied by a running undertone of melody , low down in the bass , such as I have never in my life heard before , which seems to me to sound the true manly note , the note of power .
When the Inspector , having argued out his theory to his own satisfaction , at last departed , I said to Amulya : " If you will tell me who took the money , I promise you no one shall be hurt . "
The water of the distant river is shimmering with light ; the leaves are glistening ; the rice - fields , with their fitful shivers , break into gleams of gold ; and in this symphony of Autumn , only I remain voiceless .
24 . The daughter of the house occupies a place of specially tender affection in a Bengali household ( perhaps in Hindu households all over India ) because , by dictate of custom , she must be given away in marriage so early .
Did the love which I received from her , I asked myself , come from the deep spring of her heart , or was it merely like the daily provision of pipe water pumped up by the municipal steam - engine of society ?
 God has given you women a plentiful supply of coquetry to start with , and on the top of that you have the milliner and the jeweller to help you ; but do not think we men are so helpless ... 
 I can feel the weight of your words , " I said laughing , " and if we men do not complain of your burdens , it is because women pay us so handsomely for what they make us carry . "
He of whom I knew but little , who never could assuredly be mine , whose youth flared so vigorously in a hundred points of flame -- oh , the mystery of his seething passions , so immense , so tumultuous !
It is too horrible to think of being cremated in your wretched burning - ground here , under that stumpy banian tree -- that is why I have been refusing to die , and have plagued you all this time . "
 I was sure ,  he said , " that you had the impulse of the wild deer to run away , but it is a great boon that you took the trouble to keep your promise with me . "
It was clear that the cashier 's place in the world meant nothing real to him ; it was a mere vacancy , lifeless , feelingless , with only stock phrases from the Gita -- Who kills the body kills naught !
But if fear is to regulate how people are to dress , where they shall trade , or what they must eat , then is man 's freedom of will utterly ignored , and manhood destroyed at the root . "
As it is , every moment of theirs is a life - and - death struggle for a bare living ; you cannot even imagine the difference a few pice means to them -- so little have you in common .
16 . When a relationship is established by marriage , or by mutual understanding arising out of special friendship or affection , the persons so related call each other in terms of such relationship , and not by name .
But Sandip is such an adept in setting music to his chant of praise that I cannot argue ; I lose my power of seeing truth ; my sight is clouded over like an opium - eater 's eyes .
 How can they who do not feel the truth within them , realize that to bring it out from its obscurity into the light is man 's highest aim -- not to keep on heaping material outside ? 
When I saw the Bara Rani make ready , with all her belongings , to depart from this house of ours , all the ties that bound us , to their wide - spreading ends , felt the shock . 
During the rains when this piece of water gets connected with the river , and boats can come through , great quantities of cotton yarns , and woollen stuffs for the coming winter , are brought in for sale . 
That is to say , they saw that day the vaporous envelope which was my idea , but failed to perceive the inner me , which by a curious freak of fate has been created tender and merciful . 
All the world - conquerors , from Alexander down to the American millionaires , mould themselves into a sword or a mint , and thus find that distinct image of themselves which is the source of their success . 
The other day , when the afternoon had reached the meeting - point of day and night , I had no work , nor the mind for work , nor was my master there to keep me company .
After a little , when I had recovered myself and taken my hands from my face , I saw Sandip back at the table , gathering up the sovereigns in his handkerchief , as if nothing had happened . 
That is why when your service to the country has fallen centuries into arrears all you can think of is , to make of it an image and stretch out your hands in expectation of gratuitous favours . 
Had my outward ornaments been connected with my inner feelings , then my necklet , my armlets , my bracelets , would all have burst their bonds and flung themselves over that assembly like a shower of meteors .
And yet , some time ago , when my husband began to import country - made articles into our village , he had been secretly and openly twitted for his folly , by old and young alike .
All that remained for me to ask of my God in reparation was , that I might grow up to be a model of what woman should be , as one reads it in some epic poem .
It had become an absolute necessity for me , that day , to feel that this life of mine had been able to strike some real , some responsive chord in some other harp of life .
This time there must have been a shade of concern in my low voice as I said : " The blessings of the whole country are sure to avert the evil influence of the stars . "
But when Sandip came and settled here , and his followers began to move about the country , speaking in towns and market - places , waves of excitement came rolling up to us as well .
And as I kept asking myself what could be done , and how it was to be done , the unceasing patter of my sister - in - law 's words seemed more and more intolerable .
Affecting an easy , amused laugh I said : " All the Senior Rani 's suspicions , I see , are reserved for me -- her fears of thieves and robbers are only a feint . "
Then he turned again to me and said : " Maharaja , the real thief will now probably escape , but I think I can tell you who is at the bottom of it all . "
He says we must get rid of the idea that the money belongs to the one in whose box it happens to be -- if we cannot , where is the magic of Bande Mataram ? "
If only , say they , the country had a few more of such staunch patriots , the mills of Manchester would have , had to sound their own dirge to the tune of Bande Mataram .
 If you push the same argument further you can say that since God is manifested in us , our self has to be worshipped before all else ; because our natural instinct claims it . 
Yet in my heart everything still lives -- nor even in death can I see the end of it all : rather , in death there seems to be ever so much more of repining .
This is not money , ' he exclaimed , ' but the petals of the divine lotus of power ; crystallized strains of music from the pipes that play in the paradise of wealth !
This guilt which had contaminated my life at its very root -- my God in the form of a child had left with me the means of wiping it away , and then vanished .
I found no time that afternoon even to do up my hair ; I hurriedly tied it into a loose knot , and went and worried everybody , fussing about the store - room .
He would tenderly and smilingly talk about my husband 's childlike innocence , saying that his curious doctrine and perversities of mind had a flavour of humour which made them all the more lovable .
Nikhil wants to go by made - up maxims , in Swadeshi as in everything else ; so he knocks up against human nature at every turn , and then falls to abusing it .
In the good old days , when these gaily coloured foreign shawls were unknown , our peasantry used to manage well enough with plain cotton quilts -- they must learn to do so again .
It seemed to say to me : " Dreamland ties are made , and dreamland ties are broken , but I am here for ever -- the everlasting lamp of the bridal night . "
There are the tinkle of bangles and other little sounds ; the door is perhaps shut with a shade of unnecessary vehemence ; the bookcase is a trifle stiff and creaks if jerked open .
 Amulya ,  said I , looking straight into his earnest , youthful face , " I fear nothing for myself , but may I never cease to fear for you . "
The theft is really yours , for it is my song which you have made your own -- let the name be yours by all means , but the song is mine . "
When your ' brother ' is present , your mouth waters at the very mention of Swadeshi scissors , but it is the English - made article every time when you work . "
Shall I ever recover , as from a delirium , and forget it all ; or am I to be dragged to depths from which there can be no escape in this life ?
When , like the river , we women keep to our banks , we give nourishment with all that we have : when we overflow them we destroy with all that we are .
 I have nothing against your worship as such , but how is it you propose to conduct your worship of God by hating other countries in which He is equally manifest ? 
Those who have always lain in dread of work , when with a start they awake to their sorry plight , they look to short - cuts and scamping for their deliverance . "
You have changed for me , your devotee , the picture I had of this Bengal of ours --' the soft breeze - cooled land of pure water and sweet fruit . '
Let suffering come to our house ; let the best in me shrivel up and become black ; but let this infatuation not leave me -- such seems to be my prayer .
She has left home , forgotten domestic duties ; she has nothing but an unfathomable yearning which hurries her on -- by what road , to what goal , she recks not .
The other day , when arranging the sitting - room , I brought away that double photo frame , the one in which Sandip 's portrait was next to my husband 's .
When first showing her the slippers , I chaffed her over a curious practice of hers ; " I have caught you taking the dust of my feet , thinking me asleep !
I walked on without so much as glancing at him , but as I approached the door he put himself in my way saying : " Not that way , sir . "
Had they been hard like stone , we might have had hopes of some form emerging , even as Ahalya , though turned to stone , at last won back her humanity .
 Winning your kind of success ,  Nikhil once objected , " is success gained at the cost of the soul : but the soul is greater than success . "
Then after a day or two -- as if a new light had suddenly dawned upon him -- he would send for me and say : " It was my mistake .
And therefore we two must come back to Nature , at least once a year , to tune our love anew to the first pure note of the meeting of hearts .
The Bara Rani came and asked me : " What is the meaning , brother , of all these books being packed up and sent off in box - loads ? "
 Does it not rather show ,  interposed a Master of Arts , " that trading in slavery is inherent in man -- a fundamental fact of his nature ? "
When shall all these most intimate truths of the universe overflow the pages of printed books and leap out in a sacred stream like the Ganges from the Gangotrie ? "
 We must not seek the help of illusions ,  he said to me some time ago , " for what we believe to be the true cause . "
When the women of our country wake up , he repeatedly insisted , their voice will be unmistakably confident in its utterance of the cry : " I want . "
That is why divinities are set up in every country to keep up the illusions of the people , for men are only too well aware of their weakness . "
 We are no nearer , sir ,  he said , " to solving the problem of the thief : meanwhile the mystery of the theft deepens . "
Sandip certainly has attractive qualities , which had their sway also upon myself ; but yet , I feel sure , he is not a greater man than I .
I took some money from my purse and held it out towards him , but with folded hands he protested : " I cannot take that , sir ! "
 If ,  said I , " even one of our countrymen succumbs to these overbearing desperadoes , that will indeed be a defeat for the country ! "
Then turning to me , " Queen ! " said he , " if what you have given us had been only money I would not have touched it .
 And , brother ,  she went on , " did I not warn you , it was not well to keep so much money in your room ?
Now that your path calls me , let it be a thousand times more difficult and dangerous , the dust of your feet will help me to win through .
 The very moment you sent me away ,  he said as he came in , " I had a presentiment that you would call me back .
 Respect given and taken truly balances the account between man and man ,  was the way he put it , " but veneration is overpayment . "
Amulya , poor dear boy , when he first came to me -- how the current of his life flushed with colour , like the river at dawn !
Bengal , even this collection of looseness had taken shape , and proclaimed in a thundering voice , at our very door : " Here I am . "
 Oppression ,  I replied , " will not only not prevent cow - killing , it may lead to the killing of men as well . "
 From the way you have been going on , one would hardly have thought that there was any other place in the world except my estates . 
 If that is what you really believe , there should be no difference for you between man and man , and so between country and country . 
There have been moments , I know , when I could have bounded up to her , clasped her hands and folded her to my breast , unresisting .
But was not also this very thing I had done a robbing of the whole world -- not only of money , but of trust , of righteousness ?
Chandranath Babu had no sooner come in than he cast about for some excuse to retire , mumbling : " I beg your pardon , I ... "
 If I get into trouble , sir ,  said the manager when I saw him , " I shall have to drag you in ! "
I would get angry and say : " If you feel generous , make gifts by all means , but why allow yourself to be robbed ? "
As soon as Bimala came into the sitting - room , in the evening , I said as I rose up to receive her : " Queen !
Here , in this land of India , amid the mocking laughter of Satan piercing the sky , may the feeling for this truth become real !
One finds no time to stop it : it is like trying to resist a thunderbolt : the lightning flashes : it laughs at all resistance .
When I pressed Bimala 's hand my nerves rang music , like tuned - up strings ; but the symphony stopped short at the first movement .
Only the auspicious marks with which I was endowed gained me an entry into this family -- otherwise , I had no claim to be here .
Therefore , in spite of all the applause they get , these sayings of theirs only find a place in the hiding corners of the weak .
As I have to wrestle with it every night , after my first sleep is over , I cannot call it a phantom of my imagination .
And therefore I dare not permit the evil which is in me to be exaggerated into an image of my country -- never , never ! "
 Lucky you did not think of glancing over its pages ,  I continued , " or you would have wanted to chastise me . "
 Meanwhile ,  I said ; " let me take out that money of yours and have it kept ready to take with us . "
 Is there any country , sir ,  pursued the history student , " where submission to Government is not due to fear ? "
 I now see my mistake , and if excused this time I will never ...  with which he threw himself at my feet .
As the gong of the watch rang out , sounding the hour of two , my sister - in - law came into the room .
I could hear the Bara Rani saying : " Only a minute ago I saw her making cakes and now she is busy dressing up .
If my Nikhil had not been busy dressing up his wife there is no knowing whom else he might have spent his money on ! "
 Even if the sin were yours , Panchu ,  I mused aloud , " you have surely suffered enough for it already . "
What though I shrank from his touch , and even came to loathe the lute itself ; its music was conjured up all the same .
 Are we to understand , Maharaja ,  said my visitors , " that the prosperity of the country does not interest you ? "
And if the zamindar 's summons should be peremptory enough , even some of those who had partaken of the marriage feast would be forthcoming !
Of course Nikhil 's men saw to it that the trial should come to nothing , even his law - agent being on our side !
When Bimala rose to depart and had neared the door I remarked in my most casual manner : " So , about the money ... "
When I came out my sister - in - law railed at me : " How many times are you going to dress today ? "
 But we have been to your market , Maharaja ,  the same student exclaimed , " and found nobody buying this yarn . "
For all that many of us are Vaishnavas , those of us who are Shaktas go on with their animal sacrifices just the same .
Bimala halted and faced back as she said : " On the expiry of the month , when our personal allowances become due ... "
 Sell or pawn these ,  I said , " and get me six thousand rupees as fast as ever you can . "
Ever since my arrival , Nikhil 's sitting - room had become a thing amphibious -- half women 's apartment , half men 's :
 But ,  said my master , " your gift may destroy the man , it cannot destroy the hardship of his lot .
I wanted so badly to say to him : " Do come into our room and rest awhile ; you look so tired . "
 Since Amulya is not here ,  he remarked , " I should think my turn had come for a special talk . "
 Our Chota Rani pretends not to care about these robberies , but she takes precautions on the sly , all the same . 
As a matter of fact , but for the sake of man , woman has no need for any make - believe . "
Nothing save the music of your flute can make whole that which has been broken , and pure that which has been sullied .
Whatever may be our condition , we shall either need some imaginary ghost or some actual medicine - man to terrorize over us .
 They have to answer for these thefts ; they are doing so even now ; their history is not yet ended . 
I do not fear to die for the country , to kill for the country -- that much Shakti has been given me .
I have realized my universe in this sitting - room of yours , that is why I have been a fixture here . "
Perfect gain is the best of all ; but if that is impossible , then the next best gain is perfect losing . "
 Your band of robbers ,  she went on , " have sent an anonymous message threatening to loot the treasury . "
 You need do nothing at all , Amulya , I will see to the money ,  I told him finally .
From the depths of my being an up rush of joy , like a waterspout , sprang high to storm the skies .
There was not a single soul , that day , who could forgive my husband for that act -- not even I .
On one side of a stretch of water there is held a daily bazar ; on the other , a weekly market .
My portrait there is looking the same as ever , in spite of the flowers scattered round it having been withered black !
 But , Inspector ,  I said , " why are you badgering a respectable young gentleman like Amulya Babu ? "
I say , Robber Queen , " she called out to me , " are you taking stock of your loot ? "
 I am afraid , sir ,  sneered the history student , " that you will get neither log nor tree .
But then you must give me a special talk all to myself too , or it will mean a defeat for me .
This is taking all of us some time to learn , because it runs counter to what we were taught at school .
Let those who are snake - charmers play with snakes ; if harm comes to them , they are prepared for it .
One day , he happened to awake , and smiled as he asked me : " What is that , Bimala ?
I was silent for a while and then asked again : " Could he not possibly stay a day longer ? "
There is a thorn somewhere pricking in my heart , constantly giving me pain while I am about my daily work .
I threw myself down and sobbed : " What is the end of all this , what is the end ? "
I kept the sari I had on , changing only my jacket -- for one of my jackets had its associations .
If to gain distinctness you try to know life as a machine , then such mere distinctness cannot stand for truth .
Then , coming to himself , he prostrated himself at my feet in acceptance of the relationship and did me reverence .
They know something perhaps of their home life , but when it comes to outside concerns they are entirely at sea .
I am getting old , and may die any day , so I have come to pay them back . "
Bimala was still flushed , her eyes clouded , her accents thick , as she replied : " You poor ?
To call it untrue is as hopeless as to expect to see better by plucking out our natural eyes . "
 But you must give your word ,  said Sandip Babu , " before we let you off . "
But tell us , pray , finally , are you determined not to oust foreign articles from your market ? "
Amulya produced a small bundle and said : " But , sister , I have got the six thousand . "
There was a double photo - frame on the table with Bee 's photograph by the side of Nikhil 's .
O love , my love , you have made as naught for me the truth and right and heaven itself .
From Sandip 's dry throat there came a muffled cry : " Whither would you flee , Queen ? "
My sister - in - law , when passing by , had exclaimed : " Aha , Chota Rani !
 My little mother ,  he replied , " there is no time to do anything else . "
And all the women who heard it said : " No wonder , for she resembles her mother . "
Oh , Queen Bee , to think that you should make so light of the greatest thing on earth !
I am born the saviour of the gods , to emancipate them from the thraldom of the past . "
 If that were true ,  she objected , " men would not have found women attractive . "
I have also received my reward , your prasad , as soon as I came to the palace . "
Tears came to my eyes when I tried to smile as I said : " So be it . "
But can even Nature 's nursing heal the open wound , into which our accumulated differences have broken out ?
I will never , so long as I live , allow you to bring him to your feet ! "
I could not forget those words : " You are his dissipation , and will be his ruin ! "
I have kept on watering it these days , from force of habit , and it is still green .
 Queen ,  he said , " the presence of another person does not prevent your being alone .
He said to me in a very gentle voice : " Neither am I divine : I am human .
All of a sudden a naked weakling of a human cub appears on the scene , makes sundry noises , and pokes one of the patient beasts with a cudgel , whereupon , throwing occasional glances at the human sprig out of a corner of its eye , and snatching at tufts of leaves or grass here and there on the way , the unruffled beast leisurely moves on a few paces , and that imp of a boy seems to feel that his duty as herdsman has been done .
The river lost its coating of sliminess , scattered its current in many directions , and spread out , finally , into a beel ( marsh ) , with here a patch of grassy land and there a stretch of transparent water , reminding me of the youth of this globe when through the limitless waters land had just begun to raise its head , the separate provinces of solid and fluid as yet undefined .
The woman first holds up a little mirror to her face , then puts a deal of pains into wiping and rubbing it , over and over again , with a moist piece of cloth ; and then , the folds of her upper garment adjusted and tidied , she goes , all spick and span , up to her man and sits beside him , helping him now and then in his work .
In years to come I may perchance be reminded of this night , with the tee - tee of the bird on the bank , the glimmer of the distant light on the boat off the other shore , the shining expanse of river , the blur of shade thrown by the dark fringe of trees along its edge , and the white sky gleaming overhead in unconcerned aloofness .

I cannot truthfully assert that all the seven notes of the scale could properly be distinguished in Rajnarain Babu 's singing , nevertheless he sent forth his voice and , as in the old Sanskrit works the text is drowned by the notes , so in Rajnarain Babu 's musical efforts the vigorous play of his limbs and features overwhelmed his feebler vocal performance ; his head swung from side to side marking time , while the storm played havoc with his flowing beard .
Then after our supper , the washing of our hands and feet on the verandah before stretching ourselves on the ample expanse of our bed ; whereupon one of the nurses Tinkari or Sankari comes and sits by our heads and softly croons to us the story of the prince travelling on and on over the lonely moor , and , as it comes to an end , silence falls on the room .
One day it was a poem on " Mother India " and as at the end of one line the only rhyme I could think of meant a cart , I had to drag in that cart in spite of there not being the vestige of a road by which it could reasonably arrive , -- the insistent claims of rhyme would not hear of any excuses mere reason had to offer .
Then does the burden of the child , so lightly borne by its own childishness , fall heavily on the guardian -- like that of the horse in the fable which was carried instead of being allowed to trot on its own legs : and though money procured bearers even for such a burden it could not prevent them taking it out of the unlucky beast at every step .
It was only when old Niyamat , the tailor , would forget to put a pocket into one of our tunics that we complained , for no boy has yet been born so poor as not to have the wherewithal to stuff his pockets ; nor , by a merciful dispensation of providence , is there much difference between the wealth of boys of rich and of poor parentage .
One of the pictures was of a swing hanging from a branch half - hidden in dense foliage , and in the checkered light and shade of this bower , two persons were swinging ; and there was another of a broad flight of steps leading into some castle - like palace , up and down which men and women in festive garb were going and coming .
The list of the jewellery with which she was bedecked from head to foot , and the unheard of splendour of the preparations for the bridal , might have turned older and wiser heads ; but what moved the boy , and set wonderful joy pictures flitting before his vision , was the rapid jingle of the frequent rhymes and the swing of the rhythm .
And yet if we cannot get into touch with it , if from it no breeze can blow , no current come , if no road be there for the free goings and comings of travellers , then the dead things that accumulate around us never get removed , but continue to be heaped up till they smother all life .
In infancy the loving care of woman is to be had without the asking , and , being as much a necessity as light and air , is as simply accepted without any conscious response ; rather does the growing child often display an eagerness to free itself from the encircling web of woman 's solicitude .
We , however , had no opportunity at the time for philosophising on the subject ; our backs bore as best they could the blows which befell them : and we accepted as one of the laws of the universe that it is for the Big to hurt and for the Small to be hurt .
Like the hunter whose hands itch , no sooner he spies a living creature on the top or at the foot of a tree , to kill it , whenever these came to learn of a harmless belief lurking anywhere in fancied security , they felt stirred up to sally forth and demolish it .
When of a sudden , from some innermost depth of my being , a ray of light found its way out , it spread over and illuminated for me the whole universe , which then no longer appeared like heaps of things and happenings , but was disclosed to my sight as one whole .
If , when the creation of the Arch - Poet is thus returning back to him in a flood of joy , we allow it to flow over our consciousness , we at once , immediately , become aware , in an inexpressible manner , of the end to which this flood is streaming .
First of all it was a room always closed , and then there was the stolen entry , this gave it a deep flavour of mystery ; further the broad empty expanse of terrace to the south , glowing in the rays of the sun would set me day - dreaming .
On many such occasions I have listened to him going into a rapturous dissertation on some English poem ; engaged him in some appreciative discussion , critical inquiry , or hot dispute ; or read to him some of my own writings and been rewarded in return with praise unsparing .
My father , seated amidst the throng of worshippers , would sometimes add his voice to the hymn of praise , and finding a stranger joining in their devotions they would wax enthusiastically cordial , and we would return loaded with the sanctified offerings of sugar crystals and other sweets .
Matches had to be made , but matchwood was difficult to get ; for though we all know with what fiery energy a bundle of _ khangras _ [ 40 ] can be wielded in capable hands , the thing that burns at its touch is not a lamp wick .
My brother used to go off to his court , and I would be left all alone in the vast expanse of the palace , with only the cooing of the pigeons to break the midday stillness ; and an unaccountable curiosity kept me wandering about the empty rooms .
Where the universe is expressing itself in the magic of its laws it may not be strange if we miss its infinitude ; but where the heart gets into immediate touch with immensity in the beauty of the meanest of things , is any room left for argument ?
Sometimes , at what hour I could not make out , I , half awakened , would see my father , wrapped in a red shawl , with a lighted lamp in his hand , softly passing by to the glazed verandah where he sat at his devotions .
I saw in a dream the stone steps of a temple stained with the blood of victims of the sacrifice ; -- a little girl standing there with her father asking him in piteous accents : " Father , what is this , why all this blood ? "
He would begin by gingerly dropping a few on each platter , from a sufficient height to safeguard himself from contamination [ 9 ] -- like unwilling favours , wrested from the gods by dint of importunity , did they descend , so dexterously inhospitable was he .
When , however , before turning into the evening resthouse , we look back upon the cities , fields , rivers and hills which we have been through in Life 's morning , then , in the light of the passing day , are they pictures indeed .
To my friend mentioned a while ago I said one day : " A tattered old manuscript has been discovered while rummaging in the _ Adi Brahma Samaj _ library and from this I have copied some poems by an old Vaishnava Poet named Bhanu Singha ; "
Then in the afternoon I am lying on the white floorcloth of my little room , with a drawing book trying to draw pictures , -- by no means an arduous pursuit of the pictorial muse , but just a toying with the desire to make pictures .
However sky - piercing the king of mountains may be , he can have nothing in his gift for me ; while He who is the Giver can vouchsafe a vision of the eternal universe in the dingiest of lanes , and in a moment of time .
And if the fuel of error was necessary for feeding the flame of enthusiasm then while that which was fit to be reduced to ashes will have become ash , the good work done by the flame will not have been in vain in my life .
When , later , a Pandit explained to me that in the next two lines the breeze went on " splitting the feathers of the peacock plume on the head of the eager deer - hunter , " the thinness of this last conceit disappointed me .
Because of it the words come to an end , and yet end not ; the utterance is over , but not its ring ; and the ear and the mind can go on and on with their game of tossing the rhyme to each other .
Our bodies were weary at the end of the day , our minds yearning for the inner apartments , the book was black and thick with difficult words , and the subject - matter could hardly have been more inviting , for in those days , Mother
There , in front of the servants ' quarters , was a grove of guava trees ; and , sitting in the verandah under the shade of these , gazing at the flowing current through the gaps between their trunks , my days would pass .
The same old house and the same old trees must still be there , but I know it cannot any longer be the same -- for where am I now to get that fresh feeling of wonder which made it what it was ?
One thing I was certain about , that a person charged with crime once placed in a policeman 's hands would , as sure as the wretch caught in a crocodile 's serrated grip , go under and be seen no more .
Of the inner person , behind the outward current of thoughts , feelings and events , but little is known or recked ; but for all that , he cannot be got rid of as a factor in life 's progress .
Unfortunately the words were English and the tune quite as foreign , so that we had not the faintest notion what sort of incantation we were practising ; neither did the meaningless monotony of the performance tend to make us cheerful .
Then again , while , by ten o'clock , we had to hurry through our breakfast and be ready for school , she , with her queue dangling behind , walked unconcernedly away , withinwards , tantalising us to distraction .
The autumn day wears on , the house gong sounds 12 noon , the mode changes ; though my mind is still filled with music , leaving no room for call of work or duty ; and I sing :
That a warrior poet 's ode to his beloved sword should at one time have been his favourite poem will convince the reader that even Chandranath Babu was once young ; and moreover that those times were indeed peculiar .
And now that he wanted Indian steamers to ply , he bought an empty old hulk , which in due course , was filled , not only with engines and cabins , but with loss and ruin as well .
Rejoicing in the grateful shade of the cloudy midday rest - hour , I lay prone on the bed in my inner room and wrote on a slate the imitation _Maithili _ poem _Gahana kusuma kunja majhe _.
When on the eve of leaving them I offered to settle his dues he said piteously : " I have done nothing , and only wasted your time , I cannot accept any payment from you . "
And at last , with bowed head and quavering voice I would have to make a beginning -- but too keenly conscious that to none else in the room but me was this performance sufficiently heartrending .
As one 's sleep - smothered consciousness wrestles with a nightmare in its efforts to awake , so the submerged inner self struggles to free itself from its complexities and come out into the open .
But the freedom of not being petted made up even for the harshness of this bondage , for our minds were left clear of the toils of constant coddling , pampering and dressing - up .
Our restricted social life , our narrower field of activity , was hedged in with such monotonous uniformity that tempestuous feelings found no entrance ; -- all was as calm and quiet as could be .
Once , on the roof terrace of our river - side villa , my eldest brother , at the sudden gathering of clouds , repeated aloud some stanzas from Kalidas 's " Cloud Messenger . "
The melodic forms which had become habituated to their pristine stately gait , when thus compelled to march to more lively unconventional measures , displayed an unexpected agility and power ; and moved us correspondingly .
Had the tune not been there I know not what shape the rest of the poem might have taken ; but the magic of the melody revealed to me the stranger in all her loveliness .
The day that we sought to put this to the proof , however , the hillock in the corner of our room , with all its rocks , and all its vegetation , vanished .
So in my poetical career , when the rainy season was in the ascendant there were only my vaporous fancies which stormed and showered ; my utterance was misty , my verses were wild .
There was not a leaf on the row of trees in front which stood staring at the sky with their scraggy snow - covered branches -- a sight which chilled my very bones .
He asked my brother to accompany me on the harmonium and got me to sing all my hymns one after the other , -- some of them I had to sing twice over .
But if by much contriving I managed to draw near , my youngest sister would hustle me off with : " What d' you boys want here -- get away outside . "
Who the king might be I never cared to inquire ; where his palace is still remains undiscovered ; this much was clear -- the king 's palace was within our house .
Often have I come upon him in his little room on the third storey , in the heat of noonday , sprawling on the cool polished cement floor , writing his poems .
From an outside point of view many a foreign custom would appear to have gained entry into our family , but at its heart flames a national pride which has never flickered .
My feet were bare , I had no scarf or upper - robe over my tunic , I was not dressed fit to come out ; as if it was my fault !
In one of the ravines I came upon a hollow full of spring water which overflowed as a little rivulet , where sported tiny fish battling their way up the current .
But this did not raise any barrier in my mind in the case of the boy Loken , for I could not feel that he was in any way my junior .
When I went to England I did hear some of the Irish Melodies sung , and learnt them too , but that put an end to my keenness to learn more .
When he took his leave , late in the evening , from the _ mujlis _ of our elders , I would buttonhole and drag him to our school room .
The terrible weight of an unopposed life force has not to be endured by man , -- this truth came upon me that day as a sudden , wonderful revelation .
The road over which we journey , the wayside shelter in which we pause , are not pictures while yet we travel -- they are too necessary , too obvious .
I had up to then only seen poems in printed books -- no mistakes penned through , no sign to the eye of doubt or trouble or any human weakness .
Thus do the passions of the dim ages of the immature mind , as disproportionate and curiously shaped , haunt the unending shades of its trackless , nameless wildernesses .
At what hour I cannot tell , our old nurse came running in weeping and crying : " O my little ones , you have lost your all ! "
If someone smells a flower and says he does not understand , the reply to him is : there is nothing to understand , it is only a scent .
One day my eldest sister said : " We had all hoped Rabi would grow up to be a man , but he has disappointed us the worst . "
If , on waking one fine morning we were to find gravitation reduced to only a fraction of itself , would we still demurely walk along the high road ?
Emptiness is a thing man cannot bring himself to believe in ; that which is _ not _ , is untrue ; that which is untrue , is not .
GAFFER : But that would have been a bit of a job ; I hear you 've fixed up with the dairyman to be a hawker of curds when you growup ; I 'm afraid such business won't flourish among birds ; you might land yourself into serious loss .
But he has left a jar of curd for you saying that he is rather busy with his niece 's wedding in the village , and he has got to order a band at Kamlipara .
But now that he has come , goodness knows from where , my heart is filled with his dear self , and my home will be no home to me when he leaves .
Women from our dairy village do come and draw their water from the river ; but then it isn'teveryone who has a red saree to put on .
Since the King 's Post Office I like it more and more being in doors , and as I think I shall get a letter one day ,
That 's why the sage Chyabana observes : " In medicine as in good advices , the least palatable ones are the truest . "
HEADMAN : The King says , " I am calling on you shortly ; you had better arrange puffed rice offerings for me .
AMAL : See that far - away hill from our window -- I often long to go beyond those hills and right away .
MADHAV : I am off to my work -- but , darling , you won't go out , will you ?
MADHAV : [ With folded palms ] I beseech you , headman , don't you joke about these things --
When nothing could make me acknowledge him as my King , he came all of a sudden like a terrific tempest -- God knows from where -- and scattered my men and horses and banners in one wild tumult : but now , when I am seeking the ends of the earth to pay him my humble homage , he is nowhere to be seen .
On the first day , when he left this room to my care , saying , " Surangama , you will always keep this chamber ready for me : this is all your task , " then I did not say , even in thought ,
Then he does not exist for us : then that dark chamber is totally empty and void -- no vina ever breathed its music there -- none called you or me in that chamber ; then everything has been a delusion and an idle dream .
The blaze of the fire fell on your features -- you looked like the awful night when a comet swings fearfully into our ken -- oh , then I closed my eyes -- I could not look on you any more .
None kept to their original plans ; one wanted to advance , another thought it better policy to recede ; some went to the right , others made a rush to the left : how can you call that a fight ?
I came here at the first report of thy coming -- I did not stop to hear what people were saying : all the loyalty in me went out towards thee , O Monarch , and brought me here .
Let their laughter and derision be immortal -- let them throw dust at me in the streets : this dust will to - day be the powder with which I shall deck myself before meeting my lord .
When I gave him the flowers the Queen had sent , he did not seem much interested in me at the time ; but ever since that hour he has been showering gifts and presents on me .
It is quite the contrary here ; nobody stands in your way , nobody objects to your going elsewhere if you like to ; and yet the people are far from deserting this kingdom .
What I want to say is this : you know from your experience that there can be chaos and anarchy even if a King be present : but what do we see here ?
O fool , the man that has come out to - day attired in crimson and gold to beg from you -- it is him whom you are trumpeting as your King !
Of course , that matter of your brother 's finding a hidden fortune while digging for a well -- well , you know well enough why I had to give it out .
You can take his call in any way you like -- there is none to prevent you -- he is prepared to make all kinds of welcome to suit your various tastes .
This necklace is but made of jewels , hard stones -- its hardness will give you pain -- I have got nothing like the garlands of flowers you have on .
I shall say , " For your sake have I trodden the hard and weary roads , and bitter and ceaseless has been my weeping all the way . "
Look behind you , Prince of Kanchi , your regal umbrella is lying in the dust : you have not noticed when your umbrella - holder has stolen away .
I shall stay here near the window without saying a word ; I shall not move an inch ; let me see if he will not come !
O my Queen , I have made all your good and all your evil my own as well ; will you treat me as a stranger still ?
As for roads in our country -- well , they are as good as non-existent ; narrow and crooked lanes , a labyrinth of ruts and tracks .
That dark chamber where you would come to meet me lies cold and empty within my bosom to - day -- but , O my Lord !
I tried to move him with my own bosom -- my breast is torn and bleeding -- but him I could not move an inch !
I go on obeying and acknowledging -- if it is a real King , well and good : if not , what harm is there ?
Some people laughed to see the alteration in him , but he let them laugh , and little heeded them ; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe , for good , at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset ; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway , he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins , as have the malady in less attractive forms .
The house fronts looked black enough , and the windows blacker , contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs , and with the dirtier snow upon the ground ; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons ; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off ; and made intricate channels , hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water .
Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine , and a block of curiously heavy cake , and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people : at the same time , sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of " something " to the postboy , who answered that he thanked the gentleman , but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before , he had rather not .
Away they all went , twenty couple at once ; hands half round and back again the other way ; down the middle and up again ; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping ; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place ; new top couple starting off again , as soon as they got there ; all top couples at last , and not a bottom one to help them !
In the struggle , if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary , Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright ; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him , he seized the extinguisher - cap , and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head .
When this strain of music sounded , all the things that Ghost had shown him , came upon his mind ; he softened more and more ; and thought that if he could have listened to it often , years ago , he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands , without resorting to the sexton 's spade that buried Jacob Marley .
Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat , they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog ; and one of them : the elder , too , with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather , as the figure - head of an old ship might be : struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself .
The crisp leaves of holly , mistletoe , and ivy reflected back the light , as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there ; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney , as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge 's time , or Marley 's , or for many and many a winter season gone .
It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes ; that bed was warm , and the thermometer a long way below freezing ; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers , dressing - gown , and nightcap ; and that he had a cold upon him at that time .
And every man on board , waking or sleeping , good or bad , had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year ; and had shared to some extent in its festivities ; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance , and had known that they delighted to remember him .
For , the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee ; calling out to one another from the parapets , and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball -- better - natured missile far than many a wordy jest -- laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong .
And being , from the emotion he had undergone , or the fatigues of the day , or his glimpse of the Invisible World , or the dull conversation of the Ghost , or the lateness of the hour , much in need of repose ; went straight to bed , without undressing , and fell asleep upon the instant .
But now a knocking at the door was heard , and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group , just in time to greet the father , who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents .

The very gold and silver fish , set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl , though members of a dull and stagnant - blooded race , appeared to know that there was something going on ; and , to a fish , went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement .
Even the blind men 's dogs appeared to know him ; and when they saw him coming on , would tug their owners into doorways and up courts ; and then would wag their tails as though they said , " No eye at all is better than an evil eye , dark master ! "
Every time he resolved within himself , after mature inquiry , that it was all a dream , his mind flew back again , like a strong spring released , to its first position , and presented the same problem to be worked all through , " Was it a dream or not ? "
He went to church , and walked about the streets , and watched the people hurrying to and fro , and patted children on the head , and questioned beggars , and looked down into the kitchens of houses , and up to the windows , and found that everything could yield him pleasure .
If you had fallen up against him ( as some of them did ) , on purpose , he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you , which would have been an affront to your understanding , and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister .
It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released ; it is not that the heart and pulse are still ; but that the hand WAS open , generous , and true ; the heart brave , warm , and tender ; and the pulse a man 's .
In easy state upon this couch , there sat a jolly Giant , glorious to see ; who bore a glowing torch , in shape not unlike Plenty 's horn , and held it up , high up , to shed its light on Scrooge , as he came peeping round the door .
The old man , in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste , was singing them a Christmas song -- it had been a very old song when he was a boy -- and from time to time they all joined in the chorus .
The consequences were uproarious beyond belief ; but no one seemed to care ; on the contrary , the mother and daughter laughed heartily , and enjoyed it very much ; and the latter , soon beginning to mingle in the sports , got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly .
It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror , to know that behind the dusky shroud , there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him , while he , though he stretched his own to the utmost , could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black .
He had been quite familiar with one old ghost , in a white waist coat , with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle , who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant , whom it saw below , upon a door - step .
And then let any man explain to me , if he can , how it happened that Scrooge , having his key in the lock of the door , saw in the knocker , without its undergoing any intermediate process of change -- not a knocker , but Marley 's face .
All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round ; and by - and - bye they had a song , about a lost child travelling in the snow , from Tiny Tim , who had a plaintive little voice , and sang it very well indeed .
For his pretending not to know her ; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head - dress , and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger , and a certain chain about her neck ; was vile , monstrous !
But she had scarcely entered , when another woman , similarly laden , came in too ; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black , who was no less startled by the sight of them , than they had been upon the recognition of each other .
He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed , that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home ; and he said Yes , you should ; and sent me in a coach to bring you .
Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before , and how the lord " was much about as tall as Peter ; " at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there .

The very lamplighter , who ran on before , dotting the dusky street with specks of light , and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere , laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed , though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas !
He lay , in the dark empty house , with not a man , a woman , or a child , to say that he was kind to me in this or that , and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him .
It was a strange figure -- like a child : yet not so like a child as like an old man , viewed through some supernatural medium , which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view , and being diminished to a child 's proportions .

As they sat grouped about their spoil , in the scanty light afforded by the old man 's lamp , he viewed them with a detestation and disgust , which could hardly have been greater , though they had been obscene demons , marketing the corpse itself .

It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew 's and to find himself in a bright , dry , gleaming room , with the Spirit standing smiling by his side , and looking at that same nephew with approving affability !

It was cold , bleak , biting weather : foggy withal : and he could hear the people in the court outside , go wheezing up and down , beating their hands upon their breasts , and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them .
While he did this , the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor , and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool ; crossing her elbows on her knees , and looking with a bold defiance at the other two .
In came the boy from over the way , who was suspected of not having board enough from his master ; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one , who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress .
He may rail at Christmas till he dies , but he can't help thinking better of it -- I defy him -- if he finds me going there , in good temper , year after year , and saying Uncle Scrooge , how are you ?
In almshouse , hospital , and jail , in misery 's every refuge , where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door , and barred the Spirit out , he left his blessing , and taught Scrooge his precepts .
He did pause , with a moment 's irresolution , before he shut the door ; and he did look cautiously behind it first , as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley 's pigtail sticking out into the hall .

The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets , despoil him of brown - paper parcels , hold on tight by his cravat , hug him round his neck , pommel his back , and kick his legs in irrepressible affection !
He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost , this nephew of Scrooge 's , that he was all in a glow ; his face was ruddy and handsome ; his eyes sparkled , and his breath smoked again .
When this result was brought about , old Fezziwig , clapping his hands to stop the dance , cried out , " Well done ! " and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter , especially provided for that purpose .
The city clocks had only just gone three , but it was quite dark already -- it had not been light all day -- and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices , like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air .
The Spirit stood beside sick beds , and they were cheerful ; on foreign lands , and they were close at home ; by struggling men , and they were patient in their greater hope ; by poverty , and it was rich .
He had no further intercourse with Spirits , but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle , ever afterwards ; and it was always said of him , that he knew how to keep Christmas well , if any man alive possessed the knowledge .
As the last stroke ceased to vibrate , he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley , and lifting up his eyes , beheld a solemn Phantom , draped and hooded , coming , like a mist along the ground , towards him .

But as I know your purpose is to do me good , and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was , I am prepared to bear you company , and do it with a thankful heart .
But he couldn't replenish it , for Scrooge kept the coal - box in his own room ; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel , the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part .
